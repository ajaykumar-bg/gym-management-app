## Usage

### For Administrators & Trainers

- **Check-in Members**: Use the "Check In Member" button to record arrivals
- **Monitor Active Sessions**: View currently checked-in members on the overview
- **Check-out Members**: Use the action menu to check out active members
- **View Analytics**: Monitor gym usage patterns and session statistics
- **Manage Records**: View, filter, and manage all attendance data

### For Members

- **View Attendance History**: See personal check-in/check-out records
- **Track Session Patterns**: Monitor workout frequency and duration
- **Filter Personal Data**: Use time period and status filters

## Key Components

### AttendanceContext

Provides centralized state management with:

- Attendance records management
- Member data handling
- Dialog state control
- Filtering and pagination
- Business logic for check-in/check-out operations

### Smart Filtering System

- **Time Periods**: Predefined ranges (today, this week, etc.)
- **Custom Ranges**: User-defined start/end dates
- **Member Search**: Name or membership ID lookup
- **Status Filter**: Active vs completed sessions
- **Active Filters Display**: Visual indicator of applied filters

### Validation & Error Handling

- Check-in validation (member selection, duplicate prevention)
- Check-out validation (time logic, session existence)
- User-friendly error messages
- Form validation with helpful hints

## Technical Features

### State Management

- React Context API for global state
- useReducer for complex state updates
- Optimized re-renders with useCallback
- Computed values for filtered data

### Date/Time Handling

- date-fns for robust date manipulation
- MUI X Date Pickers for user input
- Relative date displays (Today, Yesterday)
- Duration calculations and formatting

### UI/UX Features

- Material-UI components for consistent design
- Responsive table with pagination
- Loading states and error handling
- Accessible form controls and navigation
- Mobile-friendly responsive design

### Performance Optimizations

- Lazy loading of components
- Efficient filtering algorithms
- Memoized computed values
- Pagination for large datasets

## Integration Points

### Navigation

- Added to sidebar for Admin, Trainer, and Member roles
- Integrated with AppRoutes for routing
- Role-based menu labeling ("Attendance Tracking" vs "My Attendance")

### Data Flow

- Mock data for development (easily replaceable with API calls)
- Validation utilities for data integrity
- Error handling with user feedback
- Context-based state sharing

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features
