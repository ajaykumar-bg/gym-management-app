// Wrap your app with the provider
<DietPlanProvider>
  <DietPlanApp />
</DietPlanProvider>;
```

### Context Usage

```javascript
import { useDietPlan } from './features/DietPlanManagement';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const {
    dietPlans,
    assignments,
    createDietPlan,
    assignDietPlan,
    updateProgress,
  } = useDietPlan();

  // Your component logic
};
```

```

## üîß Customization

### Theme Integration

The module uses Material-UI theming and can be customized through:

- Component style overrides
- Breakpoint customization

### Constants Configuration

All application constants are centralized in `/constants/index.js`:

- Diet plan types and labels
- Status colors and labels
- Validation rules
- Chart configurations

### Mock Data

Development uses comprehensive mock data:

- Realistic diet plans with varied nutrition profiles
- Member profiles with health metrics
- Assignment history with progress tracking
- Sample analytics data for charts

## üì± Mobile Responsiveness

### Breakpoint Strategy

- **xs (0-600px)**: Single column layout, compressed cards
- **sm (600-960px)**: Two column layout, condensed tables
- **md (960-1280px)**: Three column layout, full tables
- **lg (1280px+)**: Four column layout, expanded views

### Mobile Optimizations

- Touch-friendly interfaces
